    00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.460
    Anthony: we're going to, I think, set up a meeting at 105 like right after digital marketing on Monday to recap and regroup about it.

    00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.590
    Anthony: A strategy or something like that, so, if you look at the document we split it up a little bit brandon is going to take display pretty much on his own because it's we're going to give it a little less attention.
    00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.830
    Anthony: Because NAB newest not doing it, I personally hate display as a channel and.
    00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.720
    Anthony: We have a few ideas for it like putting display ads on like phantom or something like that, but we're just going to kind of talk about it from a theoretical point of view.
    00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:01.230
    Anthony: You have the ones that you want it to you have email and social pierce is going to be like a reviewer for email because he said he used to do like email pretty that was like his full time job at some point or you did a lot of that.

    Anthony: Mike next week and see if we can have a meeting with him to let him know how we're doing and like where we are so far and asked him a couple of things, first of all, we want to see if we can have his marketing intern beyond that call as well.
    00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.700
    Anthony: Okay, we can coordinate with her a little bit, and then we just want to ask him, like.
    00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.540
    Anthony: You know, we didn't realize that we were kind of just supposed to write this from a theoretical point of view, like here's what we would do.
    00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.650
    Anthony: But if we want to actually take a day or two and like run a campaign, what would you actually want us to do that on like which channel and how much budget.
    00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.810

    00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.200
    Anthony: So if you want to take a first pass at that and just.
    00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.250
    Anthony: I don't know what you mentioned about what they've done already, but yeah.

    Emma: This is not just a.
    00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:14.820
    Emma: Nigerian perspective, this is me like approaching this from a global perspective so that's why I kind of want to hone in on stuff that I feel like I already know just to be sure that I do know that boy, and then yes search.
    00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.470
    Emma: I don't think that I can process search and display right now I wouldn't have minded the mobile because that's also very interesting, especially like.
    00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.860
    Emma: Back home, a lot of I mean the world generally mobile fest and like more so, Nick and developing countries so it's definitely something that one should explore.

    00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.250
    Ankit Mehta: This is where it's stored.
    
    00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:15.510
    Ankit Mehta: My resume is also there was also testing testing it, but I just wanted to show you this is where it will be, and it will have the same exact name of the file that you uploaded so there's no way to like tell that like which which location tracks, to which file all right.
    
    00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.070
    Ankit Mehta: I mean i'm going to look into maybe if it's possible to do that, but right now that's not not something that I can do right now.
    
    00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.310
    Victor Rieman: Okay, look at what actually is.
    
    00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.470
    Ankit Mehta: But yeah So this is the simple research okay i'm gonna give you another.
    
    00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.560
    Ankit Mehta: Link right now open that up to.
    
    00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.280
    Ankit Mehta: yeah good, so this is what like the responses will look like it will have.
    
    00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.420
    Ankit Mehta: The timestamp of when it got added into who added it and then keep scrolling horizontally.
    
    00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.810
    Ankit Mehta: So you can see.
    
    00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:06.360
    Ankit Mehta: lat long was immediately added I mean doesn't immediately it takes about like three to four seconds to actually get done, but he keeps lowering.
    
    00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.050
    Ankit Mehta: All right, so you see the edit link.
    
    00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.720
    Ankit Mehta: click on that.
    
    00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.160
    Ankit Mehta: So this is how you would be editing things.
    
    00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.410
    Ankit Mehta: So I mean change anything, I mean doesn't really matter so like yeah.
    
    00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.610
    Victor Rieman: i'm just here in change the name of the employer.
    
    00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.130
    Johnnie Kallas: So this is when we want to add additional information after the fact, or change things, yes, great.
    
    00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.100
    Ankit Mehta: Every database needs that perfect.
    
    00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.550
    Ankit Mehta: yeah you can go to that I should.
    
    00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.540
    Johnnie Kallas: And we access that from the spreadsheet.
    
    00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.340
    Ankit Mehta: yeah.
    
    00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.080
    Ankit Mehta: Ideally, what I would like to do is remove everyone's right permissions for this fight.
    
    00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:19.320
    Ankit Mehta: So, no one can actually make changes to this file, except for like me technically or like whoever is like the authorized person so like at some point of time this form will have to change owners and.
    
    00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.080
    Ankit Mehta: yeah whoever that person is.
    
    00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:35.490
    Ankit Mehta: Should like would get this Okay, so I think, at least for the normal workflow this is working it's usable as on issue right and I just realized go to the very end.
    
    00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.180
    Ankit Mehta: Good yeah just Dr dot Google where it's written right.
    
    00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.230
    Victor Rieman: This one.
    
    00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.220
    Ankit Mehta: No, no next one.
    
    00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.320
    Ankit Mehta: Okay yeah yeah that's your file so file is also getting stored non issue.
    
    00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.580
    Victor Rieman: Oh Nice.
    
    00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:59.280
    Ankit Mehta: I don't know how we would do this for multiple but yeah Okay, so all of that works out.
    
    00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:08.280
    Ankit Mehta: Now, can you do it for like the multiple one actually was trying to test this myself, but I really couldn't understand.
    
    00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.250
    Ankit Mehta: The way you to actually return the addresses for that thing.
    
    00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.420
    Okay.
    
    00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.910
    Ankit Mehta: Yes, the summit another response.
    
    00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.250
    Victor Rieman: So, this would be the.
    
    00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.540
    Ankit Mehta: 11th one is the one that i'm actually talking about on the normal strike.
    
    00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.020
    Victor Rieman: location one yeah okay.
    
    00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:46.080
    Ankit Mehta: This will take you a bit because you have 11 strike positions, so this is possibly so you if you want, since the nothing else changes you don't need to write down everything just me if you want to do the addresses because everything is the same that also works for me.
    
    00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.370
    Victor Rieman: Okay yeah this is.
    
    00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.070
    Ankit Mehta: More like waste your time too much.
    
    00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:11.880
    Victor Rieman: So we should I do the thing with a every addresses separated by the semi colon yes okay i'll just copy and paste it then the way was inputted because I Oh well, Okay, the address part is right i'm going to have to change it for the.
    
    00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:18.060
    Ankit Mehta: yeah, but you will have to remove the city's from this too and you'll have to remove the zip codes and you'll have to remove it or not.
    
    00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.820
    Ankit Mehta: OK OK.
    
    00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.570
    i'm.
    
    00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.410
    Victor Rieman: Here, let me.
    
    00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:34.500
    Ankit Mehta: This is only if capturing cities separately, is important if it's just okay being like one string then.
    
    00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:48.870
    Ankit Mehta: I don't see the problem in just doing this, where it's everything is together it's technically they're less going for me, but if you want to capture stuff separate like for like at least four states, it would be important, because we want to filter by state.
    
    00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.360
    Ankit Mehta: But otherwise that's why we need if we want to filter by anything we need a separate points.
    
    00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.570
    Ankit Mehta: And yeah if it's repeated Chicago then like just repeat Chicago as many times as you need it.
    
    00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:10.500
    Victor Rieman: yeah I mean I would be okay with us just getting rid of the city, then so, then the address contains all of it, but maybe so have stayed separate in the future.
    
    00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:17.130
    Ankit Mehta: john, what do you think if that's okay with you, if you don't need to capture cities, specifically.
    
    00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.500
    Ankit Mehta: separately.
    
    00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.980
    Johnnie Kallas: i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass you guys, but can we keep cities for now.
    
    00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:35.700
    Ankit Mehta: I mean it's not an issue for me because i've already done all the required coding for this song an extra.
    
    00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.980
    Johnnie Kallas: Then Victor i'm sorry to be a pain in the ass for you and.
    
    00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.270
    Victor Rieman: Hopefully we don't have many of these again.
    
    00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.630
    Johnnie Kallas: want me to read them out to you how would I do that.
    
    00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.770
    Victor Rieman: yeah sure it's I think oaklawn Illinois where I am right now.
    
    00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.330
    Johnnie Kallas: yeah then Chicago.
    
    00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.700
    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, it looks like bloomingdale.
    
    00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.290
    Johnnie Kallas: Then.
    
    00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.420
    Johnnie Kallas: Is that pit task, I think it a SCA.
    
    00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.310
    Johnnie Kallas: Then moments mo m E MC.
    
    00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.170
    Ankit Mehta: One that'd be seen moments.
    
    00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.140
    Johnnie Kallas: um.
    
    00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.670
    Victor Rieman: I think it's walnut street.
    
    00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.230
    Okay.
    
    00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.980
    Ankit Mehta: See that's what was confusing me because I was like is it locked up bloomingdale that doesn't make sense for the city's name.
    
    00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.650
    Johnnie Kallas: And then streeter str EA to our.
    
    00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.440
    Victor Rieman: I think that's 11 then.
    
    00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.940
    Victor Rieman: yeah yep.
    
    00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.890
    Ankit Mehta: You can just copy paste Illinois like 11 times.
    
    00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.800
    Victor Rieman: Oh right I just.
    
    00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.900
    Ankit Mehta: copy this and then just yeah.
    
    00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.150
    Johnnie Kallas: don't scroll down for zip code, so I can read all of them out to you because I can see him right now.
    
    00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.430
    Johnnie Kallas: Okay, you ready.
    
    00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.340
    Johnnie Kallas: yep 60714.
    
    00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.050
    Victor Rieman: Okay.
    
    00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:42.180
    Johnnie Kallas: 6080460614 606-256-0625 again.
    
    00:12:44.340 --> 00:13:03.630
    Johnnie Kallas: 604 or 536064360108 601-436-0954.
    
    00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:15.750
    Ankit Mehta: And finally 613648 to do this, but you'd also have to remove all of this information from the addresses.
    
    00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.150
    Victor Rieman: Okay, I get it in.
    
    00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.860
    Ankit Mehta: A job just leave the semi colon.
    
    00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.980
    Johnnie Kallas: You need a semi colon here for the last one on kid or now.
    
    00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.540
    Ankit Mehta: You actually don't put it in the last one okay.
    
    00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.570
    Victor Rieman: Okay, this one.
    
    00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.980
    Ankit Mehta: Oh cool just summit.
    
    00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.280
    Ankit Mehta: And do do me a favor.
    
    00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.300
    Ankit Mehta: Right click on the edit your response fit.
    
    00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.340
    Ankit Mehta: And then copy link address.
    
    00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.100
    Victor Rieman: Okay, send it to me.
    
    00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.740
    Ankit Mehta: Like to put in the chat.
    
    00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.430
    yeah.
    
    00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.080
    Okay.
    
    00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.100
    Okay.
    
    00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.270
    Ankit Mehta: yeah just click on the latitude longitude.
    
    00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.310
    shit.
    
    00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.160
    Ankit Mehta: Okay.
    
    00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.380
    Ankit Mehta: All right, um it did not work so i'll have to see why.
    
    00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.150
    Ankit Mehta: Okay, so.
    
    00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.690
    Ankit Mehta: This is using usable for you guys right.
    
    00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.130
    Victor Rieman: yeah.
    
    00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:09.720
    Absolutely.
    
    00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.150
    Okay.
    
    00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:22.350
    Ankit Mehta: All right, alright i'm not done yet, because I mean clearly there's some problem that's come up, but I will fix it and then probably.
    
    00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:31.950
    Ankit Mehta: end of this week, I should have some like you can start filling it in um How would you want to move data from one place to the other.
    
    00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:47.370
    Ankit Mehta: There are two options one option is obviously the copy paste the sheet one end to the other, which would still take some effort, because we don't have all the same columns right now we definitely would not have the.
    
    00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:58.860
    Ankit Mehta: anytime in the same model, but we definitely would not have the edit link at that point of time, the other way, is doing it for every form one by one, but that's like at forms to fill.
    
    00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.470
    Ankit Mehta: So, but that way you would always have an edit link for this, so this is basically.
    
    00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.960
    The.
    
    00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:11.790
    Question right now.
    
    00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.540
    Johnnie Kallas: i'm.
    
    00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.820
    Ankit Mehta: happy to answer to me right now think about it.
    
    00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.040
    Johnnie Kallas: yeah sounds good, one thing.
    
    00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:31.860
    Ankit Mehta: Because yeah I mean the edit link is the only option so like at some point of time if you're Okay, if you don't want anyone to mess, with the data is the best thing is to do is.
    
    00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:43.410
    Ankit Mehta: Only let one person control it right like one person enters and like removes the data which would be the form itself the code that is behind the form.
    
    00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:56.730
    Ankit Mehta: And if we do that, then we have to fill it formed by one by one, for the form, if you just need the sheet open, at least initially, then you wouldn't have edit links for any of those first at.
    
    00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.650
    Ankit Mehta: Things that we input.
    
    00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.270
    Johnnie Kallas: And the other banks are what you need to make out yeah.
    
    00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:14.010
    Ankit Mehta: Because if you pages copy paste into this, then I don't think we can edit them they'd like from the then the edit form won't be generated because there was no form.
    
    00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:27.180
    Johnnie Kallas: So I think what we'll do Victor if you can try and I know you're busy this week, but if you can make your one priority this week to just fill in those end dates like we talked about if you're able to, or just filling.
    
    00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:38.010
    Johnnie Kallas: there's a couple other missing information that I actually need to talk through at our next meeting, but fill in whatever you can fill in that's not filled in and i'll take the leadership on transferring everything over yeah.
    
    00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.460
    Ankit Mehta: don't.
    
    00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.050
    Ankit Mehta: I got night now.
    
    00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:47.010
    Johnnie Kallas: let's complete yeah yeah until you give me the go ahead on can I won't do anything but when you do i'll take care of that alright.
    
    00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.850
    Ankit Mehta: Alright, this was everything that I needed to see for now.
    
    00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.530
    Ankit Mehta: yeah.
    
    00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:04.290
    Ankit Mehta: i'll just fix what whatever this problem is and then it never yeah and then I contact you never works on the first never.
    
    00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.800
    Johnnie Kallas: I thought it seems like it's working just besides the.
    
    00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.400
    Ankit Mehta: Multiple location location is the thing that i'm complaining.
    
    00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:18.090
    Johnnie Kallas: yeah I mean this looks great to me so good work, and this will make it easier on our part in the long run to.
    
    00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.600
    Victor Rieman: alright.
    
    00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.270
